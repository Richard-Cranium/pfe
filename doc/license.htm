 So, you want to know about the license. Well, no need to worry, the
 pfe sources themselves are under LGPL - the 
 <a href="http://www.OpenSource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.html">
 Lesser GNU General Public License </a>
 - which gives you lots of freedom just as long as you
 ensure that the library itself compiles from sources that are 
 completly under LGPL - whatever changes you do and whatever other
 code you link the binary version of it to. An often used feature is
 the ability to add binary modules that extend the forth system,
 there are enough hooks in the pfe system to allow to change many
 internal characteristics of PFE, good ways to add closed source
 functionality through a backdoor. And that's okay as long as PFE
 can start up and work correctly without it.

<P>
 For the documentation, I think the FDL (the Free Documentation License)
 is more appropriate. Oh well, please now, let's stop about all these 
 license issues - if you have a cool application for the library,
 just ask and we can arrange for a special permission. No need to
 do like gforth, where 10% of the documentation file is just for
 explaining the "protection" from licenses - well, some people 
 would even copyright garbage just to protect you from using it
 in the wrong places. (and don't do that at home).
</P>

<P>
 The only thing that needs some explanation goes about the question
 who does actually have a copyright. The answer is simple - every
 file in the library does usually bear a copyright/author line
 near the top of the actual source file. This is the owner. The
 owner may even give another license to the file - there is just
 the implicit right to link it into an LGPL library that the PFE
 as whole represents. Some files don't have an explicit copyright
 statement, which will not make them public domain, just some 
 appropriate license is imposed from the overall PFE package.
 And the whole of the PFE has three copyright holders - where 
 acutally the history of the project defines these relationships, 
 and not some legalese.

 The first author of the PFE has been Dirk-Uwe Zoller, 
 the inventor of the project. He did start with PFE around
 1992 and he did work on PFE up to about 1995 with 0.9.14 being 
 the last version. Well, Stephan Wenk of Siemens did some patches 
 up to 0.9.22 however his version had not been seen widely, and 
 in fact the newer PFE stems from duz' 0.9.14. In fact, I did 
 contact Dirk a few times over the years but he does not have 
 an actual interest about developing a forth system anymore, 
 however he sometimes checks the comp.lang.forth newsgroup for
 references. Lately he opened an extra website, just have a
 look at <a href="http://www.dirk.zoller.de">www.dirk-zoller.de</a>
</P>

<P>
 The second author of PFE is Guido Draheim, however he did choose
 the PFE for a project request by Tektronix Berlin in 1998, and
 he is paid by Tektronix Berlin to work on PFE - and therefore the 
 second copyright goes to Tektronix. In the year 2000, the PFE
 had been actually released to customers of Tektronix, and since
 the PFE is under LGPL, the customers have a right to get access to
 the PFE sources themselves. Guido did now take the chance to ask
 the Tektronix License Manager to be allowed to maintain an open-PFE 
 version of the library - starting with the year 2000 release.
 Over time, quite some work has been done outside of the Tek Labs
 and the open-PFE project found a home at its own website at
 <a href="http://pfe.sourceforge.net">pfe.sourceforge.net</a>
 From time to time, both the Tek-PFE and Open-PFE get merged
 together, just be aware that for both versions Guido Draheim is
 the main developer. In the Changelog file, the two roles are
 distinguished by using two mail-addresses - guidod@tek.com and
 guidod@gmx.de - and these flag also the two different copyrights 
 involved.
