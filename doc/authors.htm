 years. The released version is now maintained by me, Guido Draheim

 In 1998 I had been contacting the original author Dirk-Uwe Zoller - 
 well,  his e-mail adress had changed since 1995 but I did
 find him. He told me that he has no serious intentions at all
 to do anything about Forth again, but he likes to look for
 his old project PFE on an occasional basis. He has put up
 a new homepage lately under 
 <a href="http://www.dirk-zoller.de">www.dirk-zoller.de</a>.
