	* pfe_experimental/src/main/c/struct-ext.c: 
	    move struct / structs from libpfe to pfe_experimental
	    (soon to be replaced by basic Forth200x structures) 
	* pfe_experimental/src/main/c/gettimeofday-ext.c: 
	    move p4-gettimeofday from libpfe to pfe_experimental 
	* pfe_experimental/src/main/c/socket-ext.c: 
	   move socket-dll.c from libpfe to pfe_experimental module 
	* libpfe/src/main/c/locals-ext.c (p4_word_compile_local): 
	   require Semant p4_local_execution to have LOCAL values
	   compile correctly in CTC mode.
	* while bug was fixed the test scenario handling was changed
	   in that now test*.gdb files are written.

	* libpfe/src/test/run1.in.sh: 
	     script instead of makefile-execution - easier to modify for debugging.
	* remove "_export" clauses that are not required anymore
	  which makes editing in Eclipse somewhat smoother. Since a
	  real /**..*/ comment is required for export a number of
	  comment blocks had to be updated as well. 
        * libpfe/src/tool/pfe/make-header.py: modify header generation in that
          "void FXCode" is exported as such. This will allow to define another
          return type than just "void" (atleast "int" should be possible now).
        * and elements do not need to be set "_export" anymore to be
          generated to their make-header

        * new tools/make-header.py was derived and the include/pfe/Makefile
          adapted such that a Makedeps.mk is created. This will ensure to
          rebuild header files if their source code is rebuild. - And a new
          series of header files was now created.
        * use FX_USE_CODE_ADDR / FX_USE_BODY_ADDR without {} braces
        * remove macros startig with "NFA" - and only use "NAME" now.
        * libpfe/src/main/include/pfe/def-macro.h: remove the ZNAME option
            and make it the global default. Also fix the NAMELEN macro so that
            there are  no more warnigns aboout "%.*s" precision at printf
        * libpfe/src/main/include/pfe/Makefile.am: remove everything related
            to K12 and VxWorks. All other *.c/*.h have been cleand as well.
        * **/*.c - tabs-to-spaces and remove emacs variables block.

        * libpfe/src/main/include/pfe/def-words.h: introduce P4_LISTWORDSET
           and P4_COUNTWORDSET. Make FCode obsolete and refer to FXCode.
        * in almost all libpfe/**/*.c files: replace "FCode" by "void FXCode"
           which lowers the amount of "Syntax errors" in Eclipse dramatically.

        * libpfe/src/main/c/header-sub.c: remove PFE_WITH_FFA option
            and default to FLAGSCOUNT w/ PFE_WITH_ZNAME hybrid mode.
        * libpfe/src/main/c/signals-ext.c: found one CX -> XXco missing
        * libpfe/src/main/include/pfe/def-words.h: remove old 2-char
            aliases for the loader-table (should be removed from usage already)
        * libpfe/src/main/c/dl-ext.c: remove some iOLD
        * libpfe/src/main/c/useful-ext.c: remove a number of xOLD
            and ">COMPILE" will be kept but under the name of "POSTPONE,"
        * pfe.spec: prepare 0.34.11

2009-10-18  guidod  <guidod@gmx.de>

        * libpfe/ChangeLog: moved old ChangeLog to libpfe
        * release 0.34.10 - mostly restructuring source tree layout
