        * new tools/make-header.py was derived and the include/pfe/Makefile
          adapted such that a Makedeps.mk is created. This will ensure to
          rebuild header files if their source code is rebuild. - And a new
          series of header files was now created.
        * use FX_USE_CODE_ADDR / FX_USE_BODY_ADDR without {} braces
        * remove macros startig with "NFA" - and only use "NAME" now.
        * libpfe/src/main/include/pfe/def-macro.h: remove the ZNAME option
            and make it the global default. Also fix the NAMELEN macro so that
            there are  no more warnigns aboout "%.*s" precision at printf
        * libpfe/src/main/include/pfe/Makefile.am: remove everything related
            to K12 and VxWorks. All other *.c/*.h have been cleand as well.
        * **/*.c - tabs-to-spaces and remove emacs variables block.

        * libpfe/src/main/include/pfe/def-words.h: introduce P4_LISTWORDSET
           and P4_COUNTWORDSET. Make FCode obsolete and refer to FXCode.
        * in almost all libpfe/**/*.c files: replace "FCode" by "void FXCode"
           which lowers the amount of "Syntax errors" in Eclipse dramatically.

        * libpfe/src/main/c/signals-ext.c: found one CX -> XXco missing

            aliases for the loader-table (should be removed from usage already)
        * libpfe/src/main/c/dl-ext.c: remove some iOLD
        * libpfe/src/main/c/useful-ext.c: remove a number of xOLD
            and ">COMPILE" will be kept but under the name of "POSTPONE,"
