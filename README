Use the usual gnu'ish sequence to make from sources...

> configure && make && make install

and there is "make dist" that uses the version number
from the pfe.spec file. Using "make rpm" will rebuild
everything and get you a set of rpm files. The toplevel
makefile requires that your "make" understands the -C
switch (i.e. goto directory and make there). The real
automake configure/Makefile.in are in the pfe/ subdir.

> make test

The test-directory contains scripts that you can use to test,
however they don't check for correctness - just for the
differences to the last check and so the default target 
of its Makefile will compare the reference output (in *.our) 
with the test output on the local machine (in *.out). 
To do your own comparisons, use `rm *.ou?` to get a clean 
state. The test directory is otherwise work in progress, 
constributions of tests are very welcome.
(this is old, there is now a "make check" target in the
 toplevel makefile that you can use. However, the postpone
 and signal/raise checks fail on some platforms (0.30.76))
Hacking on the sources will probably require you to 
install the aclocals helper package and a perl version.

> make doc

and "dist-doc" - the reference docmentation is extracted
from comments in the sourcefiles. You need to install the
perl-based package from    =>   http://xm-tool.sourceforge.net 
to rebuild the 0.30.x documentation.

The tarball contains the Forthprimer.pdf, a GNU FDL
tutorial for ANS Forth by Hans L. Bezeemer. It is shipped
along for your convenience, updates are made independently
at http://come.to/hansoft - the inital version of this
document was written by Hans Bezeemer, author of the
4th compiler.
