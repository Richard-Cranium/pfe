Here is testmodule1. Here we did not add some bits to allow
us to compile the testmodule within the pfe source tree. With
some autoconf/automake knowledge it should be easy to pick up
the sources and modify them to build it all outside of pfe.

If instead you want to compile another module within pfe:
- create a toplevel subdirectory in parallel to "testmodule1"
- copy the files from "testmodule1" into that new subdirectory
- modify toplevel configure.ac, somewhere near the end you
  need another ARG_WITH followed by the if...fi clause that
  implants your subdirectory into the build process.
- modify toplevel Makefile.am only in the case that you want
  to store the complete sourcetree somewhere - add your new
  subdirectory to DIST_SUBDIRS and ACSUBDIRS
- change into your new subdirectory and start modifying the
  testmodule example. Be sure to replace anything that is
  called "testmodule" of course.

That's about it, the files in this subdirectory are given
away under the ZLIB License. Basically, it requires that
you change everything and that you take all liabilities.
See the file COPYING.ZLIB for details.
