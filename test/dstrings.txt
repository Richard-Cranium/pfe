ChangeLog for the dstrings package, pfe-module version. 

2004-10-08 _ &lt;david.n.williams@umich.edu&gt; Version 0.7.2
        _ Started synchronization with the ANS Forth
          implementation on June 6, 2004.
        _ Changed MAX_DATA_STR to be the same as MAX_MCOUNT for
          long count fields, like it already was for char and
          short.
        _ Changed ARGS{ to read across lines.
        _ Rearranged word order to be more functional.
        _ Name changes, also recorded with P4_xOLD, P4_iOLD:
          Old             New
          FIND-ARG        FIND-$ARG
          ARGS{           $ARGS{
          S,              SM,
        _ New words:
          /MCOUNT  MAX-MCOUNT  MCOUNT@  MCOUNT!  MCOUNT  -MCOUNT
          $POP  $PUSH-EXT  IN-$BUFFER?  PARSE&gt;S  PARSE&gt;$
          PARSE-CAT  #$ARGS  TH-$ARG  /$FRAME-ITEM
        _ Promoted from debug to public words:
          $FRAME-DEPTH
          and other debugging words to agree with dstrings.fs
          under-the-hood words.
        _ Collapsed count size logic into a single USER-CONFIG,
          PFE_CASEOF_MCOUNT.
        _ Factored functions:
          p4_mstring_place() out of p4_mstring_comma()
          p4_s_cat()         out of S-CAT
        _ Bug fixes:
          GARBAGE? and flag cast
          $! in dynamic string copy for a string stored in two
          variables
          $FRAME underflow exception
        _ Added interpretation mode:
          CAT"  CAT`
        _ Synchronized and added comments, rationalized some
          names.
        _ Updated dstrings-ext.h prototypes.
        _ Tested all three count sizes, with dstrings-test.fs and
          trydstrings.fs.

2003-03-18 _ &lt;david.n.williams@umich.edu&gt; Version 0.6.30
        _ Fixed inverted pronunciations of GC-OFF and GC-ON.
        _ Added ( ior) DROP after FREE in trydstrings.fs.

2003-02-28 _ &lt;guidod@gmx.de&gt; Version 0.6.29
        _ modified files to pick up P4_VAR: 
        _ merge with Tektronix CMS..........

2002-06-27 _ &lt;david.n.williams@umich.edu&gt; Version 0.6.26
        _ Fixed bug in ENDCAT so it properly leaves EMPTY$ when
          there is no concatenation in progress.  Also fixed
          ENDCAT specification in dstrings-ext.c, as well as in
          dstrings.html (not in pfe distribution).

2002-05-29 _ &lt;david.n.williams@umich.edu&gt; Version 0.6.25
        _ Fixed bug in SEE-handling for ARGS{ words.
        _ Promoted $GARBAGE? to the regular dstrings word list.
        _ Renamed M" and M` to CAT" and CAT`.  Much more
          descriptive, and Guido's SYNONYM uninhibits the user
          from defining shorter synonyms.
        _ Changed C names and labels to reflect mstring
          (measured string) replacement for pstring (packed
          string) terminology.
        _ Added conditional throw compiles (#if mcount size less
          than cell size) for mcount overflow on cats and Forth
          string copies into the string buffer.  Cleaned up and
          consolidated USER-CONFIG's for mcount size.
        _ Reviewed and updated in-source documentation, updated
          prototypes.
        _ Revised dstrings.html and smodel.html.
        _ Changed the default USER-CONFIG from short-counted
          (nominally 16-bits) to long-counted strings (nominally
          32-bits).
        _ Added $FRAME-DEPTH to debugging section.
        _ Fixed a bug in ENDCAT revealed by testing with
          char-size counts.  Tests with char, short, and long
          all work, as far as they go...

2002-05-13 _ &lt;david.n.williams@umich.edu&gt; Version 0.6.24
        _ Fixed bug in p4_collect_garbage() where a string stack
          scan to update forward links was omitted for dynamic
          strings bound to variables.  Also made the link update
          code more efficient.
        _ Fixed another bug in p4_collect_garbage() by moving
          "target = next;" at top of do-loop from inside to
          outside the loop.
        _ Added $GARBAGE? in the debugging section.  Maybe it
          should be promoted to the regular dstrings word list.
        _ Improved trystrings.fs and renamed as trydstrings.fs.
